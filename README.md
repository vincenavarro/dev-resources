# Resource Search

A collection links sorted with tags so I can share them a bit easier with friends.

## TODO

* UI overhaul
* Search by partial matches (i.e. "market" matches "**market**ing")
* Search title string
* Remove invalid tags from cloud (when searching a tag, only display tags that have a match with current search)
* Move results to their own class for in-line control (add/remove tags, remove result)
* In-line json export
